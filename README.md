# Diamond-Price-Prediction-Web-Application
#### Overview

This project utilizes machine learning to predict the price of diamonds based on their carat, color, and clarity. The prediction model is built using Python with Flask for the web application.

#### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- joblib (for model persistence)
- (Add any other dependencies as needed)

#### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/U-day-1/Diamond-Price-Prediction-Web-Application.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd Diamond-Price-Prediction-Web-Application

3. Install dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

#### Usage

1. Train the model (if not already trained):

   Diamond_Price_Prediction.ipynb

2. Run the Flask web application:

   python app.py


3. Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to access the Diamond Price Prediction app.

#### Project Structure

- `Diamond_Price_Prediction.ipynb`: Python script to train the machine learning model.
- `app.py`: Flask web application for predicting diamond prices.
- `templates`: Folder containing HTML templates for the web app.
